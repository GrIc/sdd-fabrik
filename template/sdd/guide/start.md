# Start: the first batch

## GENESIS: a new project

Ask the human, one question at a time: the first useful slice, for whom, the non-goals, whose coding conventions to
follow, and the qualities that matter here: accessibility, devices, performance, cost, carbon. Write only what the
first slice needs: `README.md`, `coding-style.md` with its first rules and commands, one contract per module the
slice touches. Scaffold with the stack's generator, then strip what the slice does not use. The first delivery follows
[PLAN](plan.md) or COMPILE in [the workflow](../WORKFLOW.md).

## ADOPT: existing code

Read the existing instructions, README, tests and entry points. Keep the behavior and the existing checks. Write the
map, a coding style drawn from what the code already does, and contracts only where the intent is not obvious from code
and tests, with `governs` paths checked by `git ls-files`. Changes you would like to make become issues, not contract
text.
