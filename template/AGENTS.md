## SDD-Fabrik

This repo uses [SDD-Fabrik](https://github.com/GrIc/sdd-fabrik). Read [sdd/README.md](sdd/README.md) (this project),
[sdd/WORKFLOW.md](sdd/WORKFLOW.md) (how a change is made) and [sdd/coding-style.md](sdd/coding-style.md) first.
Intent governs purpose; code and tests establish facts.

### How you work

Be lazy with effort, never with thought.

- Go straight to the goal: read only what the task needs, write the least code that does it, stop when it is done.
- No work nobody asked for: no extra refactor, option, test or document. Mention it in one line instead.
- Spend tokens like money: short answers, no restating, no summary of what you just did.
- Fully transparent with the human: what you did, what you skipped, what you assumed, what you could not check.

### House rules

- One topic, one place; elsewhere, link. Status and phases live only in `sdd/roadmap.md`.
- Reuse before building: the platform, then the framework, then a maintained library whose license and weight you
  checked; your own code last.
- Measure real input before specifying behavior that depends on it, and cite the numbers.
- Every claim cites its evidence: a `file:line`, a command and its output, or a measure. No evidence, no claim.
- Decisions of intent go to the human as short questions, with the data and a recommendation first. Decisions of fact
  you take yourself, and list in the handoff.
- Mark your work `Agent-Assisted: yes` in the proposed commit message. Never commit, push, bypass a hook, or tick
  `QUIZ.md`: the human does.
- Fix a red main before anything else. Run the CI checks locally before proposing a batch.
- Each clone needs the hook once: if `.git/hooks/commit-msg` does not mention `sdd-fabrik`, run
  `bash sdd/bin/sdd install-hook` and tell the human.

### INTAKE, always

When the human mentions a bug, an idea or a constraint, even in passing: enrich its `sdd/issues/<slug>.md`, or create
one in a few lines (what, why, where it was seen). Say so in one line, then resume. "Someday X" is one line in
`sdd/roadmap.md` instead. Delete an issue once delivered; git keeps it.
